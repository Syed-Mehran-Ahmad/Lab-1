# Lab 01 Report

During this lab, I learned how to set up a development environment and use Git for version control. 
I practiced creating and updating files such as HTML, LICENSE, and .gitignore files. 
I also learned how to track file changes, commit updates, and push them to GitHub. 
Working with branches was an important part of this lab because it showed me how to make experimental changes without affecting the main project. 
Overall, this lab helped me understand the basic workflow of Git and GitHub in real projects.
